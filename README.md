# HydraSwap  

## Overview

[HydraSwap](https://www.hydraswap.io) is a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is dedicated to providing users with a CEX-level trading experience. Empowered by its game-changing Hydra Market Maker (HMM) core, it is a high-performance AMM focused on maximizing the returns for liquidity providers.
Our vision is to attract more liquidity into decentralized exchanges and bring the trading experience of the average DeFi user to the same level as centralized exchanges.
